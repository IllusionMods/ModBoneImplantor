# ModBoneImplantor
Plugin for Koikatsu and EmotionCreators that allows clothing mods to add physics. If you saw any clothes that are broken (stretched into the ground) you probably were missing this plugin.

## How to install
1. Install [BepInEx 5.1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) or newer. 
2. Download the [latest release](../../releases) for your game.
3. Extract the archive into your game directory. The plugin .dll should end up inside your 'BepinEx\Plugins' folder.
4. If there were any clothes that "sunk into the ground" they should now work properly.
